# Movie-guessing-game
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
1. Movie Guesser is a full-stack web-based game where players test their movie knowledge by guessing film titles based on progressive hints.
2. Players start by entering their name to join the game.
3. A random movie is selected from the database.
4. The title is hidden with dashes, and hints (year, genre, runtime, director, cast, plot) are revealed step by step.
The scoring system rewards accuracy:
âœ… Correct on first try â†’ 6 points

âš¡ Each additional hint â†’ score reduced by 1

Scores and game progress are displayed instantly without reloading the page, thanks to JavaScript Fetch API.

Players can also delete their profile from the system if they want.

This project demonstrates full-stack web development, combining frontend design, game logic, backend server handling, and database operations.
